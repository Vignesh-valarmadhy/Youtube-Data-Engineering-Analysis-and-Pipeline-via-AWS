### **Youtube-Data-Engineering-Analysis-and-Pipeline-via-AWS**

This project is focused on securely managing, processing, and analyzing large volumes of YouTube video data from structured and semi-structured formats. The analysis is centered on video categories and trending metrics, leveraging a scalable, cloud-based architecture. It integrates various AWS services for data storage, transformation, querying, and visualization to gain actionable insights from the dataset.

---

### **Project Goals**
#### **1. Data Ingestion**
Develop a robust mechanism to ingest data from multiple sources:
- Import CSV and JSON files provided in the Kaggle dataset.
- Design workflows to automatically update the data periodically.

---

#### **2. ETL System**
- **Extract**: Retrieve raw data from the Kaggle dataset and APIs. This data includes video metadata such as title, channel, views, likes, and comments.
- **Transform**: Clean, filter, and normalize the data to ensure consistency and usability. For instance:
  - Convert timestamps to a standard format.
  - Normalize category IDs to match human-readable categories.
  - Parse JSON data for insights such as category-level statistics.
- **Load**: Store transformed data into a centralized repository, such as a data lake.

---

#### **3. Data Lake**
- Build a centralized repository to store raw, transformed, and enriched data.
- Use **Amazon S3** as the storage backbone to handle large datasets and ensure accessibility across AWS services.
- Organize data into folders based on stages (e.g., raw, processed, analytics-ready).

---

#### **4. Scalability**
- Design the system to handle an increasing volume of data.
- Use serverless and scalable AWS services (e.g., AWS Glue, Lambda, Athena) to adapt to workload changes without the need for manual resource management.
- Partition data in the data lake for efficient querying and processing.

---

#### **5. Cloud Integration**
- Leverage **AWS Cloud** services for data processing and storage, enabling high performance, scalability, and cost efficiency.
- Ensure secure access and operations using **AWS IAM** (Identity and Access Management) for role-based permissions.

---

#### **6. Reporting**
- Create interactive dashboards using **Amazon QuickSight** to visualize key metrics and answer analytical questions such as:
  - Which categories are most popular?
  - What factors contribute to a video trending in different regions?
  - How does engagement (likes, comments) vary across video categories?

---

### **AWS Services Used**
#### **1. Amazon S3**
- Serves as the data lake, storing raw, transformed, and processed data.
- Provides scalability, security, and high availability for data storage.

#### **2. AWS IAM**
- Manages access controls for secure data handling.
- Implements role-based permissions for different users and services.

#### **3. AWS Glue**
- Automates data preparation and ETL tasks.
- Provides a unified catalog to discover and query datasets.

#### **4. AWS Lambda**
- Executes serverless functions to automate data transformation and ingestion processes.
- Responds to events such as new data uploads to S3.

#### **5. AWS Athena**
- Allows querying data directly in Amazon S3 without needing to load it into a database.
- Provides an interactive SQL-based interface for analytics.

#### **6. Amazon QuickSight**
- Generates visualizations and dashboards to present insights from the processed data.
- Enables stakeholders to explore trends, performance metrics, and patterns interactively.

### **Dataset Description**
#### **Source**: Kaggle YouTube Trending Videos Dataset
- **Content**: Statistics on daily trending YouTube videos over several months, segmented by region.
- **Structure**: Each region’s data is stored in separate CSV files, with associated JSON files providing category mappings.
- **Fields**:
  - **Structured Data**:
    - Video Title: The name of the video.
    - Channel Title: The creator’s channel name.
    - Publication Time: Date and time the video was published.
    - Views, Likes, Dislikes: Engagement metrics.
    - Comment Count: Total comments on the video.
  - **Semi-Structured Data**:
    - Tags: Keywords associated with the video.
    - Description: Free-text description provided by the uploader.
    - Category ID: An identifier for the video’s category, requiring mapping to human-readable labels via the JSON file.

---

### **Implementation Plan**
1. **Data Ingestion**
   - Set up scripts to download the Kaggle dataset and fetch additional data using APIs.
   - Automate periodic updates for fresh data ingestion.

2. **ETL Workflows**
   - Use AWS Glue to clean, transform, and standardize the data.
   - Extract useful features such as engagement rates (likes/views) and trends over time.

3. **Data Lake Design**
   - Partition S3 data by region and date to optimize storage and querying.
   - Maintain separate folders for raw, processed, and analytics-ready data.

4. **Trend Analysis**
   - Use AWS Athena to query the data for insights such as top-performing videos and categories.
   - Identify temporal patterns and correlations across metrics.

5. **Dashboard Creation**
   - Build visualizations in QuickSight to present:
     - Regional trends.
     - Top categories and their engagement metrics.
     - Historical trends for specific channels or tags.

---

### **Benefits**
- **Actionable Insights**: Identify what makes videos trend and analyze viewer engagement across categories and regions.
- **Scalability**: Handle increasing amounts of data seamlessly using AWS services.
- **Automation**: Eliminate manual processes by leveraging serverless workflows and scheduled tasks.
- **Security**: Protect sensitive data and ensure compliance with best practices for cloud security.
